# JAZARI 
It is a project I completed as a part of my database-systems-lab course with two other people who are listed as contributors. It is a website that allows you to 
1) Ask technical questions and get their answers  
2) Have your code reviewd by industry professionals 
3) Get mentorship from professionals.
4) Act as a recruiting tool for companies.
